### Description

I'm back, with Part 3 of creating 2D graphics using Direct3D.<br><br>

Part 3 is built on top of Part 1, still displaying the Mario character running around in circles, but contains some additions which I just found out:<br><br>

<ul>

<li>Alpha blending! (you can change the alpha value, as shown in the demo)

<li>Faster way of faking light! (this time, not using vertex color, but simply drawing a bitmap alpha-blended over the scene, more accurately simulating lighting)

<li>Using DirectDraw in combination with Direct3D! (allowing for large surfaces to be drawn, like the background)

</ul><br>

The 33 FPS in the screenshot are from my P133, however, if I turn off the background it instantly goes to 60 FPS (the maximum, since that's my monitor's refresh rate)...<br><br>

Enjoy! And don't forget to leave comments (and vote!)
